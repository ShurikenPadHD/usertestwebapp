SIGNAL VIEW – UI / UX IMPROVEMENTS (RUN BEFORE NEXT ITERATION)

1. MAIN LIST – SIGNAL SURFACE

1.1 Add Strategic Micro-Context Under Each Item

Problem
La liste est propre mais légèrement pauvre en orientation stratégique.

Improvement
Add a subtle secondary line under each signal title.

Format
Title
→ Micro strategic context (1 line, muted text)

Example
Missing primary ‘List Item’ CTA
→ Core feature: Listing initiation

Rules
	•	Max 1 line
	•	Secondary text style
	•	No paragraph
	•	Adds feature impact or friction type

⸻

1.2 Strengthen Active Selected Signal State

Problem
When drawer is open, selected item is not visually strong enough.

Improvement
Enhance active state of selected signal item.

Options (use existing design tokens only):
	•	Stronger border
	•	Slight background tint
	•	Subtle glow
	•	Left accent bar

Goal
User must clearly feel:
“This is the signal currently dissected.”

⸻

2. DRAWER – HEADER IMPROVEMENTS

2.1 Increase Header Visual Hierarchy

Problem
Title + badges + tabs feel visually equal.

Improvement
	•	Slightly increase title size or weight
	•	Add more vertical spacing under header (16–24px)
	•	Group badges into a tighter meta row

Goal
Clear visual anchor at top of drawer.

⸻

2.2 Add Strategic Lens (Classification Rationale)

Under badges, add:

Section title: Strategic Lens

Short explanation (1–2 lines max) explaining:
Why this is classified as “Access to Value” (or other dimension).

Rules
	•	Max 2 lines
	•	Body small
	•	No paragraph blocks
	•	Concrete, not generic

⸻

3. DRAWER – TAB CONTENT REFINEMENT

3.1 Add “Why This Matters” Under Each RITE Block

Inside each tab (Problem, Impact, Cause, Realignment):

Structure:

PROBLEM
Main text

Why this matters
→ 1–2 lines explaining strategic implication

Rules
	•	Max 2 lines
	•	Secondary tone
	•	Adds depth without repetition
	•	Must not restate the main sentence

⸻

3.2 Limit Text Density

For all drawer content:
	•	No block longer than 5–6 lines
	•	Keep readable line width (60–75 characters ideal)
	•	Avoid long paragraphs
	•	Prefer structured sub-blocks if needed

⸻

4. DRAWER – EVIDENCE BLOCK ENHANCEMENT

4.1 Strengthen Timestamp Visibility

Make timestamp more prominent:

Example:
4:57 (bold or accent)
Short quote below

4.2 Add Clear Jump Affordance

Add subtle:
	•	“Jump to moment”
or
	•	Clickable timestamp behavior

Goal: reinforce traceability + trust.

⸻

5. SIGNAL STRENGTH RATIONALE (BOTTOM SECTION)

Add final small section:

Why High Severity
	•	Repeated hesitation observed
	•	Affects core feature
	•	Early in flow
	•	Emotional friction detected

Rules
	•	Bullet format
	•	No paragraph
	•	3–4 bullets max

Purpose:
Explain score assignment logic transparently.

⸻

6. SPACING ADJUSTMENTS
	•	Increase vertical spacing between signal categories (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)
	•	Ensure drawer content has generous padding (24–32px)
	•	Avoid text feeling compressed

⸻

7. NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS
	•	No long academic paragraphs
	•	No duplicated explanations
	•	Every new section must add strategic clarity
	•	Compression > verbosity
	•	Signal > documentation

⸻

OBJECTIVE OF THIS ITERATION

Before adding new conceptual layers:
	•	Strengthen clarity
	•	Strengthen hierarchy
	•	Strengthen decision confidence
	•	Preserve signal density

⸻

When this is implemented, the system will feel:
	•	More deliberate
	•	More strategic
	•	More premium
	•	More trustworthy

⸻

When you’re ready after running this, we can review again and decide whether to add deeper analytical layers or stop there.
