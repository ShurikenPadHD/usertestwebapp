This is a massive leap forward! It is definitely not uneven anymore.

By moving to this 3-column "Command Center" layout, you have successfully solved the spacing issue. The visual weight is now perfectly distributed across the screen, and you’ve achieved the holy grail of complex SaaS forms: everything important is visible above the fold.

Here is a breakdown of why this works so well, along with a few high-level UX tweaks to make it completely bulletproof.

🌟 Why this is a huge success:

Perfect Balance: The 3 columns balance each other out beautifully. The user’s eye naturally reads left-to-right (Setup Context ➔ Core Instructions ➔ Financials/Launch).

Feedback Implemented: You flawlessly added the "Save Draft" button at the top right, and the "Recommended: $20" dynamic marker on the slider. This shows great attention to detail.

Space Optimization: Putting "Website" and "Founder" side-by-side in the Company card was exactly the right move to compress vertical space without it feeling cluttered.

The "Pro Tip" Placement: Tucking this under the checkout box fills that empty space perfectly and provides helpful context exactly when the user is about to spend money.

🛠️ UX/UI Polish (To make it world-class):

While the layout is stunning, there are a few functional details and micro-UI elements to refine before you build this:

1. The "Company" Card Friction (Crucial UX Question)

The Issue: You are asking the developer to fill in "Company Name, Product Name, Tagline, Website, Founder" to create a test.

The Fix: Are these details going to change for every single test they run? Usually, a developer works for one company. These fields belong in Account/Global Settings, not on the individual "Create Test" page.

Recommendation: Remove the "Company" card entirely. Auto-attach the test to their account profile. If you remove this card, you can make the "Setup" card taller, giving the "Brief context" text area much more breathing room.

2. The "Platform / Difficulty / Duration" Row Squeeze

The Issue: Look closely at the bottom of the "Setup" card. Because you put Platform, Difficulty, and Duration all on one horizontal line, the pills are getting crushed. The "Android" pill is literally touching the "E" (Easy) pill, making it look like "Android E".

The Fix: Split this into two rows.

Row 1: [Platform: Web, iOS, Android]

Row 2: [Difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard] [Duration: 5m v]
(Side note: Use the full words Easy/Medium/Hard if you have space, E/M/H can sometimes feel slightly cryptic).

3. Visual Drag Handles

The Issue: You added the great helper text "Drag to reorder" in the "What to Test" section. However, there is no physical visual cue to grab.

The Fix: Add a standard drag icon (like six little dots ⋮⋮ or horizontal lines ≡) to the immediate left of the numbers 1 and 2. This makes it instantly obvious where to click and drag.

4. Step Counter Logic Bug

The Issue: In the top right of the "What to Test" card, it says "0 steps", but right below it, you have two step input fields rendered (1 and 2).

The Fix: If the fields are blank, it's fine to show them as placeholders, but the counter should reflect what is visible, or the empty state should literally just be an "+ Add step" button with no boxes. (Small detail, but devs notice these logic things!)

Final Verdict

You absolutely nailed the layout. The "unevenness" is completely gone. If you move the generic Company info to global settings and fix the slight pill-crushing issue on the left, you will have a 10/10, enterprise-grade creation flow. Excellent work!
