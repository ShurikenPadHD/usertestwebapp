Here is a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) / Spec File for the AI-Assisted Review feature, written from the perspective of a Senior Product Manager.

You can hand this directly to your design and engineering teams to align them on what needs to be built, why it matters, and how it should behave.

📄 Product Spec: AI-Powered Video Synthesis & Review Experience

Document Status: Draft / In Review
Target Release: Q3 - V1.5
Epic: Developer Experience (DX) & Product Intelligence

1. Executive Summary & Problem Statement

The Problem: Currently, developers and PMs face a high "Time-to-Insight" (TTI). When a tester submits a 15-minute video, the client must manually watch the entire clip to find 30 seconds of actual value (a bug, a point of friction, or a failed step). This friction reduces platform engagement and lowers the perceived ROI of our tool.

The Solution: We will transform the raw video player into an "Insight Command Center." By leveraging vision and audio AI models on the backend, we will automatically extract high-value signals (rage clicks, errors, verbal confusion, task completion) and present them on a synthesized, interactive dashboard.

The Goal: Shift our SaaS positioning from a "video sourcing tool" to an "automated product intelligence platform."

2. Target Personas & Success Metrics

Primary Persona: Software Developers, Product Managers, UX Researchers.
Primary Use Case: Quickly reviewing a completed test to extract actionable feedback and approve/reject the tester's payment.

Success Metrics (KPIs):

Decrease Average Time-to-Insight: Reduce the time a developer spends on the review page per video from 100% of video duration down to < 30%.

Increase Pin Interaction: > 60% of developers clicking on AI-generated timeline pins or timestamp cards.

Faster Approval Rates: Decrease the time it takes for a tester to get paid/approved after submission.

3. User Stories

As a Developer, I want an AI-generated TL;DR of the test so that I know immediately if the user succeeded or failed without watching the video.

As a Developer, I want to see visual markers on the video timeline so I can skip directly to moments where the user encountered bugs or confusion.

As a Developer, I want to easily reject a bad test with a predefined reason so I don't pay for low-effort submissions.

4. Functional Requirements (V1)
Feature 4.1: The AI Executive Summary (TL;DR)

Location: Top of the right-hand sidebar.

Behavior: A 3-bullet text summary generated by the AI analyzing the transcript and screen.

Content Rules:

Bullet 1: Overall task completion status (e.g., "Completed 3 of 4 steps").

Bullet 2: Major friction point (e.g., "Got stuck on the pricing toggle for 2 mins").

Bullet 3: Technical/Bug status (e.g., "Encountered a 404 error during checkout").

Feature 4.2: The "Magic Timeline" (Video Player)

Location: Overlaid on the native video player's progress bar.

Behavior: The system will place color-coded interactive pins on the timeline based on AI-detected events.

Pin Categories:

🔴 Critical (Red): UI Errors, "Rage Clicks" (rapid clicking), 400/500 level visual errors.

🟡 Friction (Yellow): Long pauses (>15s no mouse movement), verbalized confusion (e.g., audio detects "I don't know," "Wait," "Where is...").

🟢 Success (Green): AI detects visual confirmation that a designated step from the Task Brief was completed.

Interaction: Hovering over a pin displays a tooltip (e.g., "04:12 - Rage Click on Submit Button"). Clicking the pin seeks the video player to that exact timestamp - 3 seconds (to provide context).

Feature 4.3: The Highlight Reel (Event Sidebar)

Location: Right-hand sidebar, below the TL;DR summary.

Behavior: A scrollable list of categorized, clickable timestamp cards corresponding to the Magic Timeline pins.

Structure: Grouped by category (Critical Issues, UX Friction, Task Progress).

Interaction: Clicking a card plays the video from that timestamp.

Feature 4.4: Approval/Rejection & Quality Control Workflow

Location: Bottom of the right-hand sidebar (sticky).

Approve Flow: Clicking "Approve" triggers a confirmation modal. Once approved, the funds are released, and a 1-5 star rating component appears to rate the tester.

Reject Flow: Clicking "Reject" opens a mandatory modal requiring a reason (Dropdown: Did not follow instructions, Fake/Wrong App, No Audio, Abusive/Spam).

Report Feature: Include a small 🚩 flag icon near the tester's profile details to report abusive notes or behavior directly to our platform admins.

5. Non-Functional Requirements & AI Logic

AI Processing Latency: The AI analysis must run asynchronously immediately after the tester uploads the video. The developer should never see a "Processing AI..." spinner if they open the review page hours later.

Transcription: The system must generate a WebVTT file for subtitles, synced to the video player.

False Positives: The AI prompt must be tuned to err on the side of caution. It is better to miss a minor sigh of frustration than to flag 50 false "Rage Clicks," which will cause the developer to lose trust in the Magic Timeline.

6. Out of Scope (Target for V2)

Cross-Video Synthesis: Aggregating data across 10 different testers into one master dashboard (e.g., "80% of users failed Step 3"). This is a high-priority V2 feature.

Auto-scrolling interactive transcript: Too complex for V1 UI. We will rely on the Highlight Reel sidebar instead.

Developer Video Clipping: Allowing the developer to cut a 10-second clip to share in Slack/Jira.

7. Design & UI/UX Guidelines

Maintain the existing dark-mode design system.

The layout must be a 2-column split (Left: Video Player 60%, Right: AI Analysis & Actions 40%).

Do not allow the "Approve/Reject" buttons to be hidden below the fold. Make the containing div sticky if the Highlight Reel is long.

Ensure high contrast for the Red/Yellow/Green pins on the blue video progress bar to maintain accessibility (WCAG) standards.

PM Notes for the Kickoff Meeting:

Engineering: Let's investigate which AI vision model is best for detecting rapid mouse clicks vs static error states.

Design: Please provide a Figma prototype of the "Hover Tooltip" for the timeline pins, and the "Reject Modal" states.
