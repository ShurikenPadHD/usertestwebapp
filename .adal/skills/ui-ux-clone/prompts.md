# Example Prompts for UI/UX Clone Skill

Here are some example prompts you can use to trigger this skill:

**Example 1: Cloning a specific component**
> "Use the ui-ux-clone skill to analyze the pricing card on https://example.com/pricing. Extract the typography, spacing, and colors. Rebuild this pricing card as a reusable React component using Tailwind CSS, and ensure it's responsive."

**Example 2: Systematizing a full page layout**
> "Navigate to https://example.com using the ui-ux-clone workflow. Extract the design tokens for their article grid layout. Create a Tailwind configuration that matches their design system, then rebuild the grid structure in React."

**Example 3: Iterating on an existing clone**
> "I started cloning the navigation bar from https://example.com, but the spacing feels off. Run the ui-ux-clone visual QA process. Compare the reference site to my local dev server at http://localhost:3000, take screenshots, and fix the Tailwind classes in `Navbar.tsx` to match the reference exactly."
