## 2–3 sentence description of the problem you solved

Getting real user feedback on apps is slow and expensive. UserTest solves this with an on-demand marketplace: developers post tasks with a budget, testers record screen + voice usability tests, and developers review and approve submissions to release payment. This makes it easy to discover UX issues before shipping, without running costly user research studies.
